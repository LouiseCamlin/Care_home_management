to run the rails server: rails s -p 5000
to run the react side: npm install
                       npm run build
                       npm start

Here is my care home manangement app.
It is pretty basic but you can add and delete residents, as well as assign residents to rooms.
You cannot add or delete rooms as in a real care home there would only be a set amount of rooms.

The rails side of the application was pretty straightforward. I used rails 5 to set up a database and help me create an api.
